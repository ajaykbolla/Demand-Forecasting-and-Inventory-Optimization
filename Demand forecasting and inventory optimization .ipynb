    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In supply chain management, forecasting demand and optimizing inventory are vital for maintaining operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. As a data analyst, I applied time series analysis to predict future sales for Product P1 and calculate safety stock levels to manage demand variability. The goal was to determine the reorder point that triggers inventory replenishment, ensuring that stock levels are optimal—neither overstocked nor understocked. Additionally, I utilized the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model to identify the most cost-efficient order quantity, reducing inventory costs. Finally, I established the reorder cycle, defining the time intervals at which orders should be placed to maintain smooth inventory operations.\n",

    "Demand Forecasting involves predicting customer order quantities and patterns, which is vital for businesses to allocate resources effectively, manage inventory, and plan production. Inventory Optimization seeks to maintain an optimal balance—ensuring enough stock is available to meet demand, while avoiding excess inventory that ties up capital and storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this analysis offers a robust approach to demand forecasting and inventory optimization for Product P1. By utilizing time series analysis, the SARIMAX model successfully forecasts future demand. Simultaneously, the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and reorder point calculations facilitate efficient inventory replenishment. The safety stock metric further mitigates risks by buffering against fluctuations in demand and supply. When combined with inventory cost analysis, these insights form a comprehensive strategy that minimizes costs while maintaining product availability. This integrated approach enhances overall supply chain efficiency and empowers data-driven decision-making, contributing to operational success."
